Logger
======

Logging of my hetaing system with a Raspberry Pi and 1-wire

A friend gave me a Raspberry Pi and some 1-wire sensors and said, 
- Do something cool with them.
And I did.....
I logg out doore temperature from the two sensors mounted in two directions on the house
and chooses the lowest temperature (shade temperature). That temperature I also send to a Swedish networking for temperature logging (www.temperatur.nu), at the moment it's 615 sations contributing with data. 
I also Logs indoor temperature on two floors, logg the suplytemperature,and the returning temperature from the shunt-control.
I also logg the top-m and bottom temperature in my storagetanks.

To be added, logg the middle of the tanks, logg the boiler, logg the pellet feeder, logg the flue (smoke gas temperature)
